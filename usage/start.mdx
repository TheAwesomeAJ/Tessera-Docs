<Note>
  All guides are written as if you are using Windows. However, tessera _should_ work on MacOS and Linux as well. The paths are the only things that may look a bit different, but everything else should be the same.
</Note>

Once you have installed `tessera` by following [this](/installation/using-pip) guide, you can run this command:

```
tessera
```

## After running `tessera`

Once you have run the command, you will see something like this.

<Info>
  Actual console formating has been left out of these docs, for simplicity purposes, but the logic stays the same.

Lets break down this UI

## User Interface

```

This part is just the welcome screen. You will only see this once.

### Log Section

```
Encryption key created: C:\Users\(Your Username)\.tessera\Keys\tessera_key_(NUMBERS).key
Password file created: C:\Users\(Your Username)\.tessera\Data\tessera_pw_(NUMBERS).json
```

This part shows where the **Encryption Key** and **Password File** is stored. On the first command run, it will show like this. However, after this, it will show as `loaded` and not `created`, unless the files are deleted. If they are deleted, the program will automatically create them.

Also, the **(NUMBERS)** is just a placeholder. When you open the terminal, it will be a 10 digit string, representing the timestamp of when the file was created. This is simply to ensure that the file is unique, and won't be written over. 

### Input Section

```
tessera >:
```

This is where you input commands. Upon program opening, and after a process finishes, this will appear.
