<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Python">
    First, run the following command to check to see if `python` is installed

    ```
    python --version
    ```

    If it is, you should see something like

    ```
    Python 3.12.6
    ```

    ---

    If it is not installed, see [Download Python | Python.org](https://Python.org)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Pip">
    `pip` should be installed by default with python. Run this command to make sure.

    ```
    pip --version
    ```

    It should return something like:

    ```Windows Windows
    pip 25.3 from C:\Users\(Your Username)\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python312\site-packages\pip (python 3.12)
    ```

    ---

    If it doesn't return anything, see [Installation - pip documentation v25.3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Tessera">
    Now that you have `python` and `pip` installed, you can install `tessera` directly from [PyPi (Python Package Index)](https://pypi.org/project/tessera.cli/), using the `pip` command. Run:

    ```
    pip install tessera.cli
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="New Step">
    Once you have installed all three programs, you will be able to run the following command anywhere to start the program.

    ```
    tessera
    ```

    This will launch the program window.
